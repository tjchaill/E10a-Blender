# E10a-Blender
This exercise will give you an opportunity to get some experience using Blender (in advance of the requirements for Project 09).

As usual, Fork and Clone this repository.

The first step will be to download and install Blender 2.82a from [https://www.blender.org](https://www.blender.org).

Then, watch (and follow along with) the first four episodes of the excellent Blender 2.8 tutorial by Grant Abbitt:

 * [Episode 1](https://youtu.be/7MRonzqYJgw)
 * [Episode 2](https://youtu.be/L0AY61v6-M4)
 * [Episode 3](https://youtu.be/WFzIbz2FN28)
 * [Episode 4](https://youtu.be/OFmKedu8r88)

The tutorials are less than an hour long, in total. They will take you through the process of creating a rather sad-looking, low-poly man holding a flashlight.

When you have completed the fourth episode of the tutorial, in Blender, choose File->Export->gLTF 2.0 and save it (as Man.glb) in the folder associated with this repository.

Update the LICENSE and README.md and then commit and push your changes. Check your Github account; your repository should have three files: LICENSE, README.md, and Man.glb

Turn in the URL to your repository on Canvas.
